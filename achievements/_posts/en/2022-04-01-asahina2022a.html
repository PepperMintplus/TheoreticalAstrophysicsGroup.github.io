<p>simulations of black hole accretion disks and disk winds in the range of mass accretion rate
from 0.1 to 10<sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>4</span><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>.</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>5</span></sup> times the Eddington limit. In this paper, we compare the results of the
INAZUMA code, in which the frequency- integrated time-dependent radiation
transfer equation is solved in order to evaluate the Eddington tensor, with those
of the first momentum (M1) approximation method. In both methods, accretion
disks and disk winds appear, and there is no remarkable difference in accretion rate,
outflow rate, or luminosity. However, the significant difference in the radiation field
appears around the rotation axis. In the M1 method, the radial component of the
radiation flux tends to be amplified owing to unphysical radiation collisions. Such an
enhancement of the outward radiation flux does not appear in INAZUMA. Also, the
problem of radiation not reaching the rotation axis occurs with M1, but not with
INAZUMA. Our results indicate that the radiation transfer equation should be solved to
obtain the accurate radiation field in the optically thin region around the rotation
axis.
