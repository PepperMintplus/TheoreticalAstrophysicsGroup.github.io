<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>It is one of the biggest issues in black hole (BH) astrophysics how to evaluate BH feedback to
its environments precisely. Aiming at studying the unique gas dynamics of super-Eddington
flow around supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high redshift, we carried out
axisymmetric two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations using a nested
simulation-box method. Here we divide the simulation box into an inner zone at (2-3 <span class='tcxr-'>×</span>
10<sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>3</span></sup>)r<sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>Sch</span></sub> (with r<sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>Sch</span></sub> being the Schwarzschild radius) and an outer zone at (2 <span class='tcxr-'>× </span>10<sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>3</span></sup>-3 <span class='tcxr-'>×</span>
10<sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>6</span></sup>)r<sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>Sch</span></sub>, with smooth connection of the physical quantities, such as gas density, velocity, and
radiation energy. We start the calculation by injecting mass through the outer boundary of the
inner zone at a constant rate of <span class='txmi-'>Ṁ</span><sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>inj</span></sub> <span class='txr-'>= 10</span><sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>3</span></sup><span class='txmi-'>L</span><sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>Edd</span></sub><span class='txmi-'>∕c</span><sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>2</span></sup>, where L<sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>Edd</span></sub> is the Eddington
luminosity and c is the speed of light. A powerful outflow is generated in the innermost
region and it propagates from the inner zone to the outer zone. The outflows are
characterized by a velocity of 0.02c (0.7c) and density of 10<sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>17</span></sup> (10<sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>19</span></sup>) g cm<sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>3</span></sup> for
near the edge-on (face- on) direction. The outflow is gradually accelerated as it
travels by accepting radiation-pressure force. The final mass outflow rate at the
outermost boundary is <span class='txmi-'>Ṁ</span><sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>out</span></sub> <span class='txsy-'>~ </span><span class='txr-'>0</span><span class='txmi-'>.</span><span class='txr-'>3 </span><span class='txsy-'>×</span><span class='txmi-'>Ṁ</span><sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>inj</span></sub>. By extrapolating the outflow structure to a
further larger scale, we find that the momentum and energy fluxes at r ~0.1 pc are
~10-100 L<sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>Edd</span></sub>/c and ~0.1-10 L<sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>Edd</span></sub>, respectively. Moreover, we find that the impacts
are highly anisotropic, in the sense that larger impacts occur towards the face-on
direction than in the edge-on direction. These results indicate that the BH feedback will
work more efficiently on the interstellar medium than assumed in the cosmological
simulations.
