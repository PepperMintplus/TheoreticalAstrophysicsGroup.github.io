<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>The homochirality of biological molecules on Earth is a long-standing mystery regarding the
origin of life. Circularly polarized ultraviolet (UV) light could induce the enantiomeric excess
of biological molecules in the interstellar medium, leading to the homochirality on Earth. By
performing 3D radiation transfer simulations with multiple scattering processes in interstellar
dusty slabs, we study the generation of the circular polarization (CP) of UV light at Ly<span class='txmi-'>α</span>
(<span class='txmi-'>λ </span><span class='txr-'>= 0</span><span class='txmi-'>.</span><span class='txr-'>1216</span><span class='txmi-'> μm</span>) as well as at near-infrared (NIR, <span class='txmi-'>λ </span><span class='txr-'>= 2</span><span class='txmi-'>.</span><span class='txr-'>14</span><span class='txmi-'> μm</span>) wavelengths. Our
simulations show that the distributions of CP exhibit a symmetric quadrupole pattern,
regardless of wavelength and viewing angle. The CP degree of scattered light from a dusty
slab composed of aligned grains is <span class='txsy-'>~</span>15 per cent for Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>and <span class='txsy-'>~</span>3 per cent at NIR
wavelengths in the case of oblate grains with an Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck size
distribution. We find that the CP degree of Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>is well correlated with that in the
NIR regardless of viewing angle, whilst being a factor of <span class='txsy-'>~</span>5 higher. Thus, a high
CP of Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>is expected at sites where NIR CP is detected. We suggest that such
circularly polarized Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>may initiate the enantiomeric excess of biological molecules in
space.
