<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >In order to evaluate the impacts made by super-Eddington accretors on their environments
precisely, it is essential to guarantee a large enough simulation box and long computational
time to avoid any artefacts from numerical settings as much as possible. In this paper, we
carry out axisymmetric two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations around a 10 M<sub><span 
class="txsy-x-x-74">⊙</span></sub>
black hole in large simulation boxes and study the large-scale outflow structure and radiation
properties of super-Eddington accretion flow for a variety of black hole accretion rates,

class="txmi-x-x-74">Edd</span></sub><span 
class="txmi-">∕c</span><sup><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span></sup> (with L<sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">Edd</span></sub> being the Eddington luminosity and c being the speed
of light). The Keplerian radius of the inflow material, at which centrifugal force
balances with gravitational force, is fixed to 2430 Schwarzschild radii. We find that
the mechanical luminosity grows more rapidly than the radiation luminosity with
an increase of <span 
class="txmi-">Ṁ</span><sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">BH</span></sub>. When seen from a nearly face-on direction, especially, the
isotropic mechanical luminosity grows in proportion to <span 
class="txmi-">Ṁ</span><sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">BH</span></sub><sup> <span 
class="txr-x-x-74">2</span><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">.</span><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">7</span></sup>, while the total
mechanical luminosity is proportional to <span 
class="txmi-">Ṁ</span><sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">BH</span></sub><sup> <span 
class="txr-x-x-74">1</span><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">.</span><span 
class="txr-x-x-74">7</span></sup>. The reason for the former is that the
higher <span 
class="txmi-">Ṁ</span><sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">BH</span></sub> is, the more vertically inflated the disk surface becomes, which makes
radiation fields more confined in the region around the rotation axis, thereby strongly
accelerating outflowing gas. The outflow is classified into pure outflow and failed
outflow, depending on whether the outflowing gas can reach the outer boundary of the
simulation box or not. The fraction of the failed outflow decreases with a decrease of
<span 
class="txmi-">Ṁ</span><sub><span 
class="txmi-x-x-74">BH</span></sub>. We analyze physical quantities along each outflow trajectory, finding that the
Bernoulli parameter (Be) is not a good indicator to discriminate between pure and
failed outflows, since it is never constant because of continuous acceleration by
radiation-pressure force. Pure outflow can arise, even if Be < 0 at the launching
point.
