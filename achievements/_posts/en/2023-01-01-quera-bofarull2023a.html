<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>The ultraviolet (UV) bright accretion disc in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) should give rise to
line driving, producing a powerful wind that may play an important role in AGN feedback
as well as in producing structures like the broad-line region. However, coupled
radiation-hydrodynamic codes are complex and expensive, so we calculate the winds instead
using a non-hydrodynamical approach (the QWIND framework). The original QWIND
model assumed the initial conditions in the wind, and had only simple radiation transport.
Here, we present an improved version that derives the wind initial conditions and has
significantly improved ray tracing to calculate the wind absorption self- consistently,
given the extended nature of the UV emission. We also correct the radiation flux for
relativistic effects and assess the impact of this on the wind velocity. These changes
mean the model is more physical, so its predictions are more robust. We find that,
even when accounting for relativistic effects, winds can regularly achieve velocities
<span class='txsy-'>≈</span>(0.1-0.5)c, and carry mass-loss rates that can be up to 80 per cent of the accreted
mass for black hole masses of 10<sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>7</span><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>9</span></sup> M<sub><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>⊙</span></sub>, and mass accretion rates of 50 per cent
of the Eddington rate. Overall, the ratio of kinetic power carried by the wind to
bolometric luminosity increases with mass accretion rate at a given black hole mass,
unlike the constant fraction generally assumed in current cosmological simulations
that include AGN feedback. The updated code, QWIND3, is publicly available in
GitHub.<sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup>
