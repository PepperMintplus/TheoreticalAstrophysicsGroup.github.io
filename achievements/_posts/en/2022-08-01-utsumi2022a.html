<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>By performing two-dimensional axisymmetric general relativistic radiation
magnetohydrodynamics simulations with spin parameter a* varying from -0.9 to 0.9, we
investigate the dependence on the black hole spin of the energy flow from a supercritical
accretion disk around a stellar mass black hole. It is found that optically and geometrically
thick disks form near the equatorial plane, and a part of the disk matter is launched from the
disk surface in all models. The gas ejection is mainly driven by the radiative force, but
magnetic force cannot be neglected when <span class='txsy-'>∣</span>a*<span class='txsy-'>∣</span> is large. The energy outflow efficiency (total
luminosity normalized by <span class='txmi-'>Ṁ</span><sub><span class='txr-x-x-74'>in</span></sub><span class='txmi-'>c</span><sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>2</span></sup><span class='txr-'>; </span><span class='txmi-'>Ṁ</span><sub><span class='txr-x-x-74'>in</span></sub> and c are the mass-accretion rate at the event
horizon and the light speed) is higher for rotating black holes than for nonrotating
black holes. This is 0.7% for a* = -0.7, 0.3% for a* = 0, and 5% for a* = 0.7 for
<span class='txmi-'>Ṁ</span><sub><span class='txr-x-x-74'>in</span></sub> <span class='txsy-'>~ </span><span class='txr-'>100</span><span class='txmi-'>L</span><sub><span class='txr-x-x-74'>Edd</span></sub><span class='txmi-'>∕c</span><sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>2</span></sup> (L <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>Edd</span></sub> is the Eddington luminosity). Furthermore, although the
energy is mainly released by radiation when a* ~0, the Poynting power increases
with <span class='txsy-'>∣</span>a*<span class='txsy-'>∣</span> and exceeds the radiative luminosity for models with a* <span class='txsy-'>≥ </span>0.5 and a* <span class='txsy-'>≤</span>
-0.7. The faster the black hole rotates, the higher the power ratio of the kinetic
luminosity to the isotropic luminosity tends to be. This implies that objects with a
high (low) power ratio may have rapidly (slowly) rotating black holes. Among
ultraluminous X-ray sources, IC342 X-1, is a candidate with a rapidly rotating black
hole.
