<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>For testing different electron temperature (T <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>e</span></sub>) prescriptions in general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations through observations, we propose to utilize
linear polarization (LP) and circular polarization (CP) images. We calculate the polarization
images based on a semi-magnetically arrested disk GRMHD model for various T <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>e</span></sub>
parameters, bearing M87 in mind. We find an LP-CP separation in the images of the low-T <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>e</span></sub>
disk cases at 230GHz; namely, the LP flux mainly originates from downstream of the jet, and
the CP flux comes from the counter-side jet, while the total intensity is maximum at the jet
base. This can be understood as follows: although the LP flux is generated through
synchrotron emission widely around the black hole, most of the LP flux from the jet base
does not reach the observer, since it undergoes Faraday rotation ( <span class='txsy-'>∝ </span><span class='txmi-'>T</span><sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>e</span></sub><sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>2</span></sup> ) when passing
through the outer cold disk and is thus depolarized. Hence, only the LP flux from the
downstream (not passing the cold dense plasmas) can survive. Meanwhile, the CP flux is
generated from the LP flux by Faraday conversion ( <span class='txsy-'>∝ </span>T <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>e</span></sub>) in the inner hot region.
Stronger CP flux is thus observed from the counter-side jet. Moreover, the LP-CP
separation is more enhanced at a lower frequency, such as 86 GHz, but is rather
weak at 43 GHz, since the media in the latter case is optically thick for synchrotron
self-absorption so that all of the fluxes should come from the photosphere. The
same is true for cases with higher mass accretion rates and/or larger inclination
angles.
