<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>We present integral field, far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy of Mrk 54, a local Lyman
continuum emitter, obtained with FIFI-LS on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy. This is only the second time, after Haro 11, that [C II] 158 <span class='txmi-'>μ</span>m and [O III] 88 <span class='txmi-'>μ</span>m
spectroscopy of the known LCEs have been obtained. We find that Mrk 54 has a strong [C II]
emission that accounts for <span class='txsy-'>~ </span><span class='txr-'>1</span>% of the total FIR luminosity, whereas it has only
moderate [O III] emission, resulting in the low [O III]/[C II] luminosity ratio of
0.22  0.06. In order to investigate whether [O III]/[C II] is a useful tracer of f <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>esc</span></sub>
(LyC escape fraction), we examine the correlations of [O III]/[C II] and (i) the
optical line ratio of O<sub><span class='txr-x-x-74'>32</span></sub> <span class='txsy-'>≡ </span>[O III] 5007 A/[O II] 3727 A, (ii) specific star formation
rate, (iii) [O III] 88 <span class='txmi-'>μ</span>m/[O I] 63 <span class='txmi-'>μ</span>m ratio, (iv) gas-phase metallicity, and (v) dust
temperature based on a combined sample of Mrk 54 and the literature data from the
Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey and the LITTLE THINGS Survey. We find that
galaxies with high [O III]/[C II] luminosity ratios could be the result of high ionization
(traced by O<sub><span class='txr-x-x-74'>32</span></sub>), bursty star formation, high ionized-to-neutral gas volume filling
factors (traced by [O III] 88 <span class='txmi-'>μ</span>m/[O I] 63 <span class='txmi-'>μ</span>m), and low gas-phase metallicities,
which is in agreement with theoretical predictions. We present an empirical relation
between the [O III]/[C II] ratio and f <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>esc</span></sub> based on the combination of the [O III]/[C II]
and O<sub><span class='txr-x-x-74'>32</span></sub> correlation, and the known relation between O<sub><span class='txr-x-x-74'>32</span></sub> and f <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>esc</span></sub>. The relation
implies that high-redshift galaxies with high [O III]/[C II] ratios revealed by the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array may have f<sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>esc</span></sub> <span class='txsya-'>≳ </span>0.1, significantly
contributing to the cosmic reionization. <sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>*</span></sup> Based on observations done with FIFI-LS on
SOFIA.
