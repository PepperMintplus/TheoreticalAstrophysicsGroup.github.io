<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>We present UV and Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>radial surface brightness (SB) profiles of Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>emitters (LAEs) at z =
2.84 detected with the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. The depth of our data,
together with the wide-field coverage including a protocluster, enable us to study the
dependence of Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>halos (LAHs) on various galaxy properties, including Mpc scale
environments. UV and Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>images of 3490 LAEs are extracted, and stacking the images
yields SB sensitivity of <span class='txsy-'>~ </span><span class='txr-'>1 </span><span class='txsy-'>× </span><span class='txr-'>10</span><sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>20</span></sup> <span class='txr-'>erg</span><span class='txmi-'>s</span><sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup> <span class='txr-'>cm</span><sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>2</span></sup> <span class='txmi-'>rmarcsec</span><sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>2</span></sup> in Ly<span class='txmi-'>α</span>, reaching the expected
level of optically thick gas illuminated by the UV background at <span class='txmi-'>z </span><span class='txsy-'>~ </span><span class='txr-'>3</span>. Fitting of the
two-component exponential function gives the scale-lengths of 1.56  0.01 and 10.4  0.3 pkpc.
Dividing the sample according to their photometric properties, we find that, while the
dependence of halo scale- length on environment outside of the protocluster core is not clear,
LAEs in the central regions of protoclusters appear to have very large LAHs, which could be
caused by combined effects of source overlapping and diffuse Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>emission from
cool intergalactic gas permeating the forming protocluster core irradiated by active
members. For the first time, we identify UV halos around bright LAEs that are
probably due to a few lower-mass satellite galaxies. Through comparison with recent
numerical simulations, we conclude that, while scattered Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>photons from the host
galaxies are dominant, star formation in satellites evidently contributes to LAHs, and
that fluorescent Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>emission may be boosted within protocluster cores at cosmic
noon and/or near bright QSOs. <sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>*</span></sup> This research is based on data collected at the
Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of
Japan.
