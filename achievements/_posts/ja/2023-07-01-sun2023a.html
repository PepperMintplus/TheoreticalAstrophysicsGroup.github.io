<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>We present cosmological-scale three-dimensional neutral hydrogen (H I) tomographic maps
at z = 2-3 over a total of 837 deg<sup><span class='txr-x-x-74'>2</span></sup> in two blank fields that are developed with Ly<span class='txmi-'>α </span>forest
absorptions of 14,736 background Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars at z = 2.08-3.67.
Using the tomographic maps, we investigate the large-scale (<span class='txsya-'>≳</span>10 h <sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup> cMpc) average H I
radial profiles and two-direction profiles of the line-of-sight (LOS) and transverse directions
around galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 2-3 identified by the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope Dark Energy eXperiment survey and SDSS, respectively. The peak of the H I radial
profile around galaxies is lower than the one around AGNs, suggesting that the dark matter
halos of galaxies are less massive on average than those of AGNs. The LOS profile of
AGNs is narrower than the transverse profile, indicating the Kaiser effect. There
exist weak absorption outskirts at <span class='txsya-'>≳</span>30 h <sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup> cMpc beyond H I structures of galaxies
and AGNs found in the LOS profiles that can be explained by the H I gas at <span class='txsya-'>≳</span>30
h <sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup> cMpc falling toward the source position. Our findings indicate that the H I
radial profile of AGNs has transitions from proximity zones (<span class='txsya-'>≲</span>a few h <sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup> cMpc) to
the H I structures (<span class='txsy-'>~</span>1-30 h <sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup> cMpc) and the weak absorption outskirts (<span class='txsya-'>≳</span>30 h
<sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup> cMpc). Although there is no significant dependence of AGN types (type 1 vs.
type 2) on the H I profiles, the peaks of the radial profiles anticorrelate with AGN
luminosities, suggesting that AGNs’ ionization effects are stronger than the gas mass
differences.
