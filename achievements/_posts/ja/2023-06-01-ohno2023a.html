<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>The nature of molecular clouds and their statistical behavior in subsolar metallicity
environments are not fully explored yet. We analyzed data from an unbiased CO (J = 2-1)
survey at the spatial resolution of <span class='txsy-'>~ </span><span class='txr-'>2 </span>pc in the northern region of the Small Magellanic
Cloud with the Atacama Compact Array to characterize the CO cloud properties. A
cloud-decomposition analysis identified 426 spatially/velocity- independent CO clouds and
their substructures. Based on the cross-matching with known infrared catalogs by Spitzer and
Herschel, more than 90% CO clouds show spatial correlations with point sources. We
investigated the basic properties of the CO clouds and found that the radius-velocity linewidth
(R-<span class='txmi-'>σ</span> <sub><span class='txmi-x-x-74'>v</span></sub>) relation follows the Milky Way-like power-law exponent, but the intercept is <span class='txsy-'>~ </span><span class='txr-'>1</span><span class='txmi-'>.</span><span class='txr-'>5</span>
times lower than that in the Milky Way. The mass functions (dN/dM) of the CO
luminosity and virial mass are characterized by an exponent of <span class='txsy-'>~ </span><span class='txr-'>1</span><span class='txmi-'>.</span><span class='txr-'>7</span>, which is consistent
with previously reported values in the Large Magellanic Cloud and in the Milky
Way.
