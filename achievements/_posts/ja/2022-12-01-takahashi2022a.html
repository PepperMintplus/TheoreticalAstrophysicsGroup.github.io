<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>We develop the three-dimensional general relativistic radiative transfer code: CARTOON
(Calculation code of Authentic Radiative Transfer based On phOton Number conservation in
curved space-time) which is improved from the two-dimensional code: ARTIST developed
by Takahashi &amp; Umemura (2017). In CARTOON, the frequency- integrated general
relativistic radiative transfer equation is solved in a photon number-conserving
manner, and the isotropic and coherent scattering in the zero angular momentum
observers (ZAMO) frame and the fluid rest frame is incorporated. By calculating the
average energy of photons, energy conservation of the radiation is also guaranteed.
With the test calculations in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space, we
have demonstrated that the wavefront propagation in black hole space- time can be
correctly solved in CARTOON conserving photon numbers. The position of the
wavefront coincides with the analytical solution and the number of photons remains
constant until the wavefront reaches the event horizon. We also solve the radiative
transfer equation on the geodesic reaching the observer’s screen. The time variation of
the intensity map on the observer’s screen can be simultaneously and consistently
calculated with the time variation of the radiation field around the black hole. In
addition, the black hole shadow can be reproduced in moderately optically thin
situations.
