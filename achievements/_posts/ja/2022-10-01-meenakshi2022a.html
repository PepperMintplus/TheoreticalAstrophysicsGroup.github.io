<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>Relativistic jets are believed to have a substantial impact on the gas dynamics and evolution
of the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies. In this paper, we aim to draw a link
between the simulations and the observable signatures of jet-ISM interactions by
analyzing the emission morphology and gas kinematics resulting from jet-induced
shocks in simulated disc and spherical systems. We find that the jet-induced laterally
expanding forward shock of the energy bubble sweeping through the ISM causes
large-scale outflows, creating shocked emission and high-velocity dispersion in the entire
nuclear regions (~2 kpcs) of their hosts. The jetted systems exhibit larger velocity
widths (&gt;800 km s<sup><span class='txsy-x-x-74'>-</span><span class='txr-x-x-74'>1</span></sup>), broader Position-Velocity maps and distorted symmetry in the
disc’s projected velocities than systems without a jet. We also investigate the above
quantities at different inclination angles of the observer with respect to the galaxy. Jets
inclined to the gas disc of its host are found to be confined for longer times, and
consequently couple more strongly with the disc gas. This results in prominent shocked
emission and high-velocity widths, not only along the jet’s path, but also in the
regions perpendicular to them. Strong interaction of the jet with a gas disc can also
distort its morphology. However, after the jets escape their initial confinement, the
jet-disc coupling is weakened, thereby lowering the shocked emission and velocity
widths.
