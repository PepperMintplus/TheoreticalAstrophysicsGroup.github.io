<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>We present a general relativistic radiative transfer code RAIKOU () for multiwavlength
studies of spectra and images including the black hole shadows around Kerr black holes.
Important radiative processes in hot plasmas around black holes, i.e., (cyclo-)synchrotron,
bremsstrahlung emission/absorption, and Compton/inverse-Compton scattering, are
incorporated. The Maxwell-Juttner and single/broken power-law electron distribution
functions are implemented to calculate the radiative transfer via both thermal and
nonthermal electrons. Two calculation algorithms are implemented for studies of
the images and broadband spectra. An observer-to-emitter ray-tracing algorithm,
which inversely solves the radiative transfer equation from the observer screen to
emitting plasmas, is suitable for an efficient calculations of the images, e.g., the
black hole shadows observed by the Event Horizon Telescope, and spectra without
Compton effects. On the other hand, an emitter- to-observer Monte Carlo algorithm, by
which photons are transported with a Monte Carlo method including the effects of
Compton/inverse-Compton scatterings, enables us to compute multiwavelength spectra, with
their energy bands broadly ranging from radio to very high energy gamma-ray.
The X-ray black hole shadows, which are formed via synchrotron emission and
inverse- Compton scattering processes and will be observed in the future X-ray
interferometry missions, can be also computed with this algorithm. The code is
generally applicable to accretion flows around Kerr black holes with relativistic jets and
winds/coronae with various mass accretion rates (i.e., radiatively inefficient accretion
flows, super-Eddington accretion flows, and others). We demonstrate an application
of the code to a radiatively inefficient accretion flow onto a supermassive black
hole.
