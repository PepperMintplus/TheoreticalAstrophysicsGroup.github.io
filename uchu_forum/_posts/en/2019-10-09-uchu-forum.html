<p>
Recently, using Subaru and ALMA, we were able to make a series of press releases entitled “most distant XYZ”. That is, the most distant oxygen (2016.6), the most distant bright emission line (2018.5), the most distant galaxy merger (2019.6), the most distant passive galaxy (2019.9), and the most distant primitive galaxy cluster (2019.9). I will explain these research results in detail. In particular, I shall focus on observations of high-redshift galaxies using ALMA. I shall outline plans for the continuation of research related to the “most distant” objects or phenomena in the JWST and ELT era.
