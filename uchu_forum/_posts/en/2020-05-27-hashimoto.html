<p>Observations of distant galaxies are important for (i) elucidating the evolution of galaxy formation, and (ii) understanding the contribution of galaxies to the reionization of the universe. In recent years, a number of candidate distant galaxies have been discovered by large ground-based telescopes and space telescopes, some of which have been studied in detail by spectroscopic observations. In this talk, we introduce the results and future prospects of our group's world-leading work on distant galaxies with the ALMA telescope.</p>
