<p>The results from Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope observations of nearby galaxies NGC 1068, NGC 253, and IC 342 on the composition of the molecular gas will presented. NGC 1068 contains an active galactic nucleus (AGN), and the 45 m observations provide good spatial resolution to investigate the composition of the molecular gas in the vicinity of AGN. Follow-up ALMA observations complement the informatin of the spatial distributiion of molecular species. Some preliminary results from our ongoing observational campaigns will also be presented.
