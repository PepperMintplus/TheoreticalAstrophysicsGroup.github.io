<p>Observations of the cosmic background radiation have established the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) model as the standard cosmological model, and on large scales the $\Lambda$CDM model has been very successful, providing the backbone of the cosmic large-scale structure. However, on small scales below 1 Mpc, there are still many gaps in our understanding of galaxy formation. In particular, feedback from supernova explosions and SMBHs plays an important role in self-regulating the growth of galaxies and SMBHs, but the detailed mechanisms are still poorly understood.</p>

</p>Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have become an essential tool for cosmological studies of galaxy and supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation. Some recent high-resolution zoom-in simulations have achieved resolutions of less than 10 parsecs. However, it is still difficult to simulate a large number of galaxies down to redshift $z=0$ at such high resolution, and physical subgrid models are still needed for star formation and feedback.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will describe recent efforts to develop feedback models based on high-resolution simulations of superbubbles (Oku et al. 2022). I will also show the possibility of distinguishing feedback models by comparing cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with observations of galaxies, IGM tomography, and cross-correlation functions (Momose et al. 2021abc; Nagamine et al. 2021). If time permits, I will also present the results of the implementation of dust formation and destruction models in galaxy simulations.</p>
