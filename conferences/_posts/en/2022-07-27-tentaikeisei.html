<p>This workshop aims to provide an opportunity to exchange views and share information about the current status of observations and theoretical research on a wide range of aspects concerning the formation of astronomical objects. </p>

<p>Moreover, it also serves as interim report by students in our research group who are working on dissertations.</p>

<p>This year, the meeting will be held over two days, November 4 and 5. In view of the coronavirus infection situation, we plan to have a hybrid format consisting of on-site participation in the CCS workshop room and online participation via Zoom. (The format and availability of the workshop dinner may be subject to change depending on the coronavirus situation.)</p>

<p>You are welcome to upload your slides in advance. This will be helpful for everyone when following the talks online.</p>
