<p>This workshop aims to provide an opportunity to exchange views and share information about the current status of observations and theoretical research on a wide range of aspects concerning the formation of astronomical objects. </p>

<p>Moreover, it also serves as interim report by students in our research group who are working on dissertations.</p>

<p>In view of the recent COVID-19 situation, we will hold the event online this year. We will let you know how to connect to the workshop once you have registered. </p>

<p>You are welcome to upload your slides in advance. This will be helpful for everyone when following the talks online.</p>
